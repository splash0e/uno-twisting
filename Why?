why using it ti Drive speaker and LED?

This project demonstrates how the Arduino Uno can simultaneously control an audio output (speaker) and visual indicators (LEDs) using digital signal generation and timing control.
The system generates musical tones through a connected speaker while synchronizing LED patterns with the rhythm and frequency of the sound. It showcases real-time multitasking using microcontroller-based timing logic.

why Aurdino-
1. It provides stable 5V logic-level outputs
2. It supports PWM and tone generation via hardware timers
3. It can control multiple output devices simultaneously
4. It allows precise timing control using delay() and millis()
5. It is simple, accessible, and ideal for embedded experimentation
