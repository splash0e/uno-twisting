The system successfully generates synchronized audio and visual output.
The Arduino Uno produces musical tones through a speaker while simultaneously driving LED indicators in timed coordination with the sound pattern.
Both outputs operate reliably without signal interference, demonstrating stable multi-output control using the ATmega328P microcontroller.
